🔄 Project Flow (Step-by-Step)
1. Frontend (React + HTML/CSS)
Login/Signup Page → Collects user credentials

Dashboard/Home → Displays featured songs, playlists, recommendations

Search Bar → Allows users to search songs/artists/albums

Music Player Component → Play, pause, skip, volume control

Playlist Management → Create, edit, delete playlists

Profile Page → User info, listening history, liked songs

👉 React handles state management (Redux/Context API) and communicates with backend APIs.

2. Backend (.NET Core Web API)
Authentication Service

User registration & login

JWT token-based authentication

Music Catalog Service

Fetch song metadata (title, artist, album, duration)

Search functionality

Streaming Service

Handles audio file requests

Streams chunks of audio (HLS/DASH protocols)

Playlist Service

CRUD operations for playlists

Recommendation Engine

Suggests songs based on user history

3. Database (MySQL)
Tables:

Users → User info, credentials (hashed passwords)

Songs → Song metadata (title, artist, album, genre, file path)

Playlists → Playlist details linked to users

PlaylistSongs → Mapping between playlists and songs

UserActivity → Listening history, likes, shares

👉 MySQL ensures relational integrity and fast queries. Use indexes for search optimization.

4. Storage & Streaming
Audio files stored in local server or cloud (AWS S3, Azure Blob)

CDN integration for faster delivery

Streaming handled via chunked audio delivery (progressive download or adaptive bitrate)

5. Flow of User Journey
User opens app → React frontend loads

Login request → Sent to .NET API → Validates against MySQL

User searches song → Query hits Songs table → Results returned

User clicks play → React player requests audio chunks from backend → Backend streams file from storage

User adds song to playlist → API updates PlaylistSongs table

Recommendation engine queries UserActivity → Suggests new songs
